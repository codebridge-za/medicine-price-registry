# üìã Medicine Price Registry


Retail medicine prices are regulated in South Africa through the Single Exit Price Mechanism. These prices are published on a regular basis at [www.mpr.gov.za](http://www.mpr.gov.za). The information is only available in a large and unwieldy excel spreadsheet making it inaccessible to casual users.

This projects builds an API and basic user interface to query this database. You can find a running instance at [mpr.netlify.com](https://mpr.netlify.com/).

A typical use-case would be for a consumer to look for alternative products for a particular medicine, often generic medicines can be much cheaper than the branded product. Another use-case allows consumers to ensure that they are not being overcharged for their medicines. This database publishes the maximum price at which a medicine can be sold. A pharmacy cannot legally increase the price of a particular medicine above the price listed here.

## API
In addition to providing this simple web interface, we make available a rudimentary API that you can use to access the most up-to-date prices to be used in third party applications.

## Note
- This project is currently making use of **CSS Modules** for styling purposes temporarily.
- When adding to the project, please follow the folder and file structure already in place.
- This project is following the *eslint-config-airbnb* styleguide.

## TODO
- [] Change style convention to make use of **Styled Components** as well as **Material UI** components.
- [] Add CSS spinner before each ajax call.
- [] Redesign and submit new feature ideas.
- [] Create a script that downloads the latest database instead of shipping a sqlite db with the repo.
- [] It might be useful to compare prices over time.
- [] Seems like there are some spelling errors in the database - e.g. paracetamol and paracetemol. Might need to clean the database through some sort of fuzzy match and possibly report those errors back to mpr
